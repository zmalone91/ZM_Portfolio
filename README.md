# [Project 1 - Cryptocurrency Comparison and Sentiment Analysis Tool: Project Overview](https://github.com/zmalone91/Crypto_Sentiment)
* Created a web app using python dash to compare prices between two cryptocurrencies side-by-side and simultaneously search tweets about the cryptocurrencies to perform a basic negative/positive sentiment analysis.
* Dash web application houses the data and includes a dropdown list of all current products available on Coinbase Pro that have a USD trading pair.
* Selecting cryptocurrencies from the dropdown lists automatically updates the price chart and tweet sentiment analysis.
* The tool dynamically brings in 24 hours worth of historical data using the Coinbase Pro API python library cbpro.
* Using tweepy, tool dynamically brings in the most recent 100 tweets and who tweeted, their follower count, and the Positive/Neutral/Negative sentiment analysis of their tweet using TextBlob. <br><br><br>
